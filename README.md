## Power BI Product Dashboard

<p>Project Objective

  Stakeholder wanted a dashboard report that solely focuses on Case Units, monitoring the top 120 products being brought by our members solely. It will be updated will new data monthly.</p>
  
<p>KPIs:
  
-	Product Ranking: A table which will allow us to see how the products are performing i.e. a product ranked 5th last month may move up to 1st for the current month. Possible use of arrows to indicate the products movements in table. (Top 120 Products)

-	Product Tracking: A line graph which will allow us to see the historic and up-to-date performance of products.
 
-	 Other Features: Further breakdown of products into categories i.e. Frozen, Ambient, Chilled & Non-Food. Some members have purchased smaller business that suppliers have data from, so I was required to aggregate the unit as part of the parent member.</p>
